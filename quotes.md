## Squeal of the Wounded fanboi

Is there nothing so shrill, so piercing? When they finally realize that they
directed enthusiasm - even affection - and invested personal identity in
a corporation, they are still so enthralled that they feel betrayed instead of
enlightened.

Look. Microsoft, Apple, Google? You are just a bit of tissue and they will wad
you up, when finished wiping. Apple wipes their nose, while Microsoft wipes
somewhere lower in the anatomical procession... Small comfort to reflect upon,
as you trace an arc through the air, upon disposal.
